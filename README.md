# Brainstem_Attractor_Landscape

Code repository for the paper - 'The structural and functional connectivity between distinct neuromodulatory systems underpins dynamic shifts in brain network topology and attractor landscape topography', Taylor et al. (2022)

Dynamic Functional connectivity folder contains all corresponding code for the dynamic functional connectivity analysis performed in this paper. Functions in the dynamic functional connectivity folder are dependent on external functions, including code from https://github.com/macshine/coupling and https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/.

MSD folder contains all corresponding code for the attractor landscape and mean-squared displacement analysis conducted in this paper, note - this code is modified from Munn et al., 2021, Nature Comms paper (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26268-x).

Figure folder contains code for creating the figures in the papers.
